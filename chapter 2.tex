\section{Definitions.}\label{sec:2.1} If $X$ is any space, the set $\Vect(X)$ has the structure of an abelian semigroup, where the additive structure is defined by direct sum. If $A$ is any abelian semigroup, we can associate to $A$ an abelian group $K(A)$ with the following property: there is a semigroup homomorphism $\alpha: A \to K(A)$ such that if $G$ is any group, $\gamma: A \to G$ any semigroup homomorphism there is a unique homomorphism $\chi: K(A) \to G$ such that $\gamma = \chi \alpha$. If such a $K(A)$ exists, it must be unique. \par

The group $K(A)$ is defined in the usual fashion. Let $F(A)$ be the free abelian group generated by the elements of $A$, let $E(A)$ be the subgroup of $F(A)$ generated by those elements of the form $a+a' - (a \oplus a')$ where $\oplus$ is the addition in $A$, $a, a' \in A$. Then $K(A) = F(A)/E(A)$ has the universal property described above, with $\alpha: A \to K(A)$ being the obvious map. \par

A slightly different construction of $K(A)$ which is sometimes convenient is the following. Let $\Delta: A \to A \times A$ be the diagonal homomorphism of semi-groups, and let $K(A)$ denote the set of cosets of $\Delta(a)$ in  $A \times A$. It is, a quotient semi-group, but the interchange of factors in $A \times A$ induces an inverse in $K(A)$ so that $K(A)$ is a group. We then define $\alpha_A: A \to K(A)$ to be the composition of $a \to (a, 0)$ with the natural projection $A \times A \to K(A)$ (we assume $A$ has a zero for simplicity). The pair $(K(A), \alpha_A)$ is a functor of $A$ so that if $\gamma: A \to B$ is a semi-group homomorphism we have a commutative diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[rr, "\alpha_A"] \arrow[dd, "\gamma"'] &  & K(A) \arrow[dd, "K(\gamma)"] \\
                                               &  &                              \\
B \arrow[rr, "\alpha_B"]                       &  & K(B)                        
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
If $B$ is a group $\alpha_B$ is an isomorphism. That shows $K(A)$ has the required universal property. \par 

If $A$ is also a semi-ring (that is, $A$ possesses multiplication which is distributive over the addition of $A$) then $K(A)$ is clearly a ring. \par \hfill

If $X$ is a space, we write $K(X)$ for the ring $K(\Vect(X))$. No confusion should result from this notation. If $E \in \Vect(X)$, we shall write $[E]$ for the image of $E$ in $K(X)$. Eventually, to avoid excessive notation, we may simply write $E$ instead of $[E]$ when there is no danger of confusion. \par 

Using our second construction of $K$ it follows that, if $X$ is a space, every element of $K(X)$ is of the form $[E] - [F]$, where $E, F$ are bundles over $X$. Let $G$ be a bundle such that $F \oplus G$ is trivial. We write $\underline{n}$ for the trivial bundle of dimension $n$ . Let $F \oplus G = \underline{n}$. Then $[E] - [F] = [E] + [G] - ([F] + [G]) = [E \oplus G] - [\underline{n}]$. Thus, every element of $K(X)$ is of the form $[H] -  [\underline{n}]$. \par 

Suppose that $E, F$ are such that $[E] = [F]$, then again from our second construction of $K$ it follows that there is a bundle $G$ such that $E \oplus G \cong F \oplus G$. Let $G'$ be a bundle such that $G \oplus G' \cong \underline{n}$. Then $E \oplus G \oplus G' \cong F \oplus G \oplus G'$, so $E \oplus \underline{n} \cong F \oplus \underline{n}$. If two bundles become equivalent when a suitable trivial bundle is added to each of them, the bundles are said to be \textit{stably equivalent}. Thus, $[E] = [F]$ if and only if $E$ and $F$ are stably equivalent. \par 

Suppose $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map. Then $f^*: \Vect(Y) \to \Vect(X)$ induces a ring homomorphism $f^*: K(Y) \to K(X)$. By (\ref{lem:1.4.3}) this homomorphism depends only on the homotopy class of $f$. \newpage
